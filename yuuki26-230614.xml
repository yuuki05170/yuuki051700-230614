<text>I put the rice cooker with the random onions and frozen pork with 100g of water.
The resultant was 800g, so *0.6% = 4.8g of salt must be added.
The salt equivalent of the curry flakes was 2.2g per 30g so i added 75g.</text>

the essential change is only the 1st line.
against *both* P-26 and P-76, G-32 had to be white's optimal move. no matter whether P-26 (or P-76) is optimal for black.

<text>Can be divided into 2 parts: what you've done and what you're doing now.
Biography and lifestreaming.
For music, the former is what songs you've listened to in your life, and the latter is what songs you're listening to now (or recently).

<text>P11 is the move here. If Kx, white can draw.
Black declines with K31.
Then N*21 is a trap.
Black appears to win with (a) P*22, but it leads to a loss with N33+.
Black still wins with (b) Lx, but P12! (below) is an incredible defense.

Then P23+ N21+ P33 N22 P23 Nx Kx K21 P13+ L31+ P12 L32 (below).
White's move here is the problem.
Amateur's is, for example, N*11 or K13. https://pic.twitter.com/jnqovHqO1G</text>

babel (essentially) transpiles
export default class Complex { … }
to
window.Complex = { __esModule: true, default: function () { … } };

that means in a browser the user must write
new Complex.default(3, 4);
instead of
new Complex(3, 4);

<text>so i initially thought Wolfram Alpha was better for math questions, as Stephen Wolfram wrote.
but when i asked it to "write a node.js script to get a url and retry if a network error occurs," i realized its power.
it returned the perfect code.

<text>i first asked, "what is the probability of getting all faces of a die when rolled six times?"
ChatGPT answered with a long explanation, "(1/6) * (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) * (2/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^6 = 0.0000213."
this is wrong and inconsistent. the correct answer is 6!/6^6 = 0.0154....</text>

<text>on 2nd thought, i'm thinking of buying an M3 Air next new year's.
Mac Mini is silly. it's roughly the same size and weight as a MacBook but it has no display etc.

i ended up losing ¥300. it costs ¥1,100 to send it back bc i asked for pickup. the gift card was deducted from the refund. only 800 rakuten points for that amount remained. https://twitter.com/yuukikonnobot/status/1614345252290318336</text>

22. N-65 was dangerous. if 25. Rx22+ Gx B*55 i would've lost. instead 22. P-86 Px P*88 was the move.

<text>One thing came to my mind is という may be used more to describe abstract concepts. E.g.,
3つの辺を持つ多角形を三角形という。
(A polygon with three sides is called a triangle.)
Here と呼ぶ is also perfectly fine, but may be "excessive", although the difference is slight.</text>

<text>As a Dark-type attacker, it is strong against TGR, but weak in raids.
This is because of its Bite/Crunch moveset.
In raids, Snarl/Foul Play or Dark Pulse is stronger, which can be used by Mega Houndoom or Mega Absol.</text>

It says that the salt equivalent is 2.3g for the noodles/seasoning and 5.2g for the soup, for a total of 7.5g.

Because evolving + powering up + teaching a new attack would cost 125 + 378 + 60 = 563 &amp;#127852; per S-Mamo.</text>

Now I could find the prime factorizations of the decimal repunits up to R(20).
R(21) &amp;gt; 2^64 - 1, so I can't calculate any further in my environment.

<text>This seems to be the same or a little slower than the previous implementation.
But it is a little faster with the `-O1' option.
This was the same result for clang++ and g++.
Is it because of the optimization to access vector elements?</text>

<text>What we notice here is that if we print the primes from 2, we will know the smaller primes, so "dividing by primes" will actually be possible.

<text>Let q and r be integers.
Every integer n can be expressed as n = 6q + r where 0 &amp;lt;= r &amp;lt;= 5.
If r = 0, 2, or 4, then n is an even number.
If r = 3, then n is a multiple of 3.
Therefore, integers that are not a multiple of 2 or 3 are of the form either 6q + 1 or 6q + 5.</text>

<text>Further optimization.
Once we know that 2 is prime, we only need to look at integers that are not a multiple of 2, i.e., odd numbers.
Once we know that 2 and 3 are prime, we only need to look at integers that are not a multiple of 2 or 3.</text>

<text>`i &amp;lt;= sqrt_n' can also be written as `i * i &amp;lt;= n', but `i * i' can overflow.
By writing `i &amp;lt;= n / i', the overflow can be avoided.
Not sure which is faster, calculating `n / i' for each loop or pre-calculating `sqrt(n)'.</text>

<text>Also, consider whether 113 is prime: it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, ... then there is no need to divide by 11.
If 113 = 11 * x, then x &amp;lt; 11 (because 11^2 = 121 &amp;gt; 113).
Thus, to test if n is prime, it is enough to divide by primes &amp;lt;= sqrt(n).</text>

<text>Let d != 0 and n be integers.
d is a divisor of n iff there exists an integer k such that n = kd.
In the above equation, for k &amp;gt; 1, d is maximized when k = 2, and then d = n/2. n/2 is not guaranteed to be an integer, but gives an upper bound. QED.</text>

<text>Also, it can be proved that the largest non-trivial divisor d of an integer n satisfies d &amp;lt;= n/2, and d = n/2 iff n is even, so `i &amp;lt; n / 2' is sufficient for `i &amp;lt; n' in `is_prime'.</text>

<text>Improvements to this are:
* The type of the argument for `is_prime' should be `const int'. According to SO, it is good practice to use `const' for constants as in JavaScript.
* For reusability, `main' should be factored out to "a function that returns a vector of primes &amp;lt;= x".</text>

<text>Next, let's write a program on prime numbers as a simple problem.
First, write a program to print prime numbers &amp;lt;= 100.
An integer n &amp;gt;= 2 is prime iff it is not divisible by any integer i where 2 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt;= n - 1.
